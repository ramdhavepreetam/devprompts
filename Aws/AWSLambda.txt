Title: Building a Lambda API that connects to a database and writes data to an S3 bucket

Prompt: 

You are tasked with building a Lambda API using the parameterized programming technology of your choice (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.). This API should establish a connection with a database, retrieve data from it, and subsequently write this data into an AWS S3 bucket. 

The parameters for this task are as follows:

1. Programming Technology for Lambda: ___________ 
2. Database Type (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.): ___________ 
3. Database Connection Details (host, user, password, database name): ___________ 
4. SQL Query or Method for Data Retrieval: ___________ 
5. AWS S3 Bucket Name: ___________ 
6. AWS Credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key): ___________ 

## Requirements

The code should be of production quality, meaning it should include error handling, logging, and be optimized for performance. The code should also be well-commented, making it easy for other developers to understand and maintain.

## Deliverables

1. Lambda function code in the chosen programming language that connects to the specified database and retrieves data based on the given SQL query or method.
2. Code that writes the retrieved data to the specified S3 bucket.
3. Test cases that demonstrate the successful operation of the function.
4. Documentation of the function, including a description of its operation, any dependencies, and how to deploy and run it.
5. Store all the details in the secreate. 
6. Use the lambda development as per the dev cert and prod. 
7. it should have proper exception handling. 
8. Make all the code with mudular and functions 

Please follow best practices for your chosen programming language and AWS services. The task is to fill in the parameters with the appropriate details, write the code fulfilling the above requirements, and test it to ensure it functions as expected.
