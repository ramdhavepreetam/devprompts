# AWS Lambda API - Connect to Database and Write Data to S3 Bucket

This project involves creating an AWS Lambda function using a programming language of your choice. The function will connect to a database, retrieve data, and subsequently write that data into an AWS S3 bucket.

## Parameters

1. **Programming Technology for Lambda:** (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)
2. **Database Type:** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
3. **Database Connection Details:** (host, user, password, database name)
4. **SQL Query or Method for Data Retrieval:** 
5. **AWS S3 Bucket Name:**
6. **AWS Credentials:** (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key)

## Requirements

The code should be of production quality, meaning it should include error handling, logging, and be optimized for performance. The code should also be well-commented, making it easy for other developers to understand and maintain.

## Deliverables

1. Lambda function code in the chosen programming language that connects to the specified database and retrieves data based on the given SQL query or method.
2. Code that writes the retrieved data to the specified S3 bucket.
3. Test cases that demonstrate the successful operation of the function.
4. Documentation of the function, including a description of its operation, any dependencies, and how to deploy and run it.

Please follow best practices for your chosen programming language and AWS services. The task is to fill in the parameters with the appropriate details, write the code fulfilling the above requirements, and test it to ensure it functions as expected.
